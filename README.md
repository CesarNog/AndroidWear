# AndroidWear
Android Wear app that features all the basic components from wearable support library.

This repository is a detailed example of building apps for android wear devices which are these days making a mark in the gadget 
market. To get started [Developing Android wear Apps: Android wear Fundamentals](http://developer.android.com/training/building-wearables.html)

#Installation
Clone the repository and check the repository from oldest commits.

#WearableListView
An alternative version of ListView that is optimized for ease of use on small screen wearable devices. 
It displays a vertically scrollable list of items, and automatically snaps to the nearest item when the user stops scrolling.
[Google Developer Documentaion](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable/view/WearableListView.html).
With customlayout and custom adapter this example triggers a toast whenever user taps on the listitem.

#DelayedConfirmationView 
DelayedConfirmationView provides a circular countdown timer, typically used to automatically confirm an operation after a short delay has elapsed.
The delay is intended to give the user a chance to cancel the operation by tapping the View.

#GridViewPager
Layout manager that allows the user to navigate both vertically and horizontally through pages of content. 
You supply an implementation of a GridPagerAdapter to generate pages for the view to show

#Wearable Activity
Base activity class for use on wearables. Provides compatibility for Ambient mode support.

Some Wear apps are most useful when they are constantly visible to the user. For example, 
users out on a run can glance at their wearable to see the distance covered and time elapsed, 
or after recording a grocery list on their wearable, users can quickly see which items are remaining on the list as they shop at the market. 
Making an app constantly visible has an impact on battery life, 
so you should carefully consider that impact when adding this feature to your app.

#Basic and MultiPage Notifications
When you'd like to provide more information without requiring users to open your app on their handheld device,
you can add one or more pages to the notification on the wearable. 
The additional pages appear immediately to the right of the main notification card.

#Stacked and Action Button Notifications
When creating notifications for a handheld device, you should always aggregate similar notifications into a single summary notification. 
For example, if your app creates notifications for received messages, you should not show more than one notification on a handheld deviceâ€”when
more than one is message is received, use a single notification to provide a summary such as "2 new messages."

#Voice Reply Notifications
If you have handheld notifications that include an action to input text, such as reply to an email, 
it should normally launch an activity on the handheld device to input the text. 
However, when your notification appears on a wearable, there is no keyboard input, so you can let users dictate a reply or provide pre-defined text messages using RemoteInput.
[Google Developer Documentation](http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/notifications/voice-input.html)

#Custom Notifications
Creating layouts for wearables is the same as handheld devices,
except you have to design for the screen size and for glanceability. 
Do not port functionality and the UI from a handheld app and expect a good experience.
You should create custom layouts only when necessary. 
Read the design guidelines for information on how to design great wearable apps.

#Android Wear WatchFace
Watch faces in Android Wear leverage a dynamic digital canvas to tell time using colors, animations, and relevant
contextual information. The Android Wear companion app provides watch faces with different styles and shapes.
When users select one of the available watch faces on the wearable or on the companion app, the wearable device 
previews the watch face and lets the user set configuration options.
Android Wear enables you to create custom watch faces for Wear devices. When users install a handheld app that contains
a wearable app with watch faces, they become available in the Android Wear companion app on the handheld device and in the
watch face picker on the wearable device.
This class teaches you to implement custom watch faces and to package them inside a wearable app. This class also covers design considerations and implementation tips to ensure that your designs integrate with system UI elements and are power-efficient.
